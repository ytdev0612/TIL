are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new.\",\n"," 'To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation.',\n"," 'Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing.',\n"," 'Consider Facit.',\n"," \"I'm actually old enough to remember them.\",\n"," 'Facit was a fantastic company.',\n"," 'They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.',\n"," 'Everybody used them.',\n"," 'And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?',\n"," 'They continued doing exactly the same.',\n"," 'In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone.',\n"," 'Gone.',\n"," 'To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators.',\n"," 'Facit did too much exploitation.',\n"," 'But exploration can go wild, too.',\n"," 'A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company.',\n"," \"Let's call them OncoSearch.\",\n"," 'The company was brilliant.',\n"," 'They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer.',\n"," 'Every day was about creating something new.',\n"," 'They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, \"When we only get it right,\" or even, \"We want it perfect.\"',\n"," 'The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete.',\n"," 'OncoSearch did too much exploration.',\n"," 'I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.',\n"," 'The founder of the idea is Jim March.',\n"," 'And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.',\n"," 'Exploration.',\n"," \"Exploration is about coming up with what's new.\",\n"," \"It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations.\",\n"," \"It's about changing our frontiers.\",\n"," 'Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.',\n"," 'I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.',\n"," 'We all know that exploration is risky.',\n"," \"We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high.\",\n"," 'Exploitation is the opposite.',\n"," 'Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better.',\n"," 'Exploitation is about making our trains run on time.',\n"," \"It's about making good products faster and cheaper.\",\n"," 'Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term.',\n"," \"But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term.\",\n"," 'And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic.',\n"," \"That's the risk of exploitation.\",\n"," 'So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.',\n"," 'If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.',\n"," 'Small children, they explore all day.',\n"," \"All day it's about exploration.\",\n"," 'As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.',\n"," 'The same goes for companies.',\n"," 'Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent.',\n"," 'And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.',\n"," 'And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.',\n"," 'For example, \"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?\"',\n"," 'Or, \"How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?\"',\n"," 'So, doing one well is difficult.',\n"," 'Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation.',\n"," \"So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel.\",\n"," 'But when they do, the payoffs are huge.',\n"," 'So we have lots of great examples.',\n"," 'We have Nestlé creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.',\n"," 'Why is balancing so difficult?',\n"," \"I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are.\",\n"," \"So I'll talk about two, but there are many.\",\n"," \"So let's talk about the perpetual search trap.\",\n"," \"We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work.\",\n"," 'So instead of staying with it, we create something new.',\n"," \"But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.\",\n"," 'OncoSearch was a good example.',\n"," 'A famous example is, of course, Xerox.',\n"," \"But we don't only see this in companies.\",\n"," 'We see this in the public sector as well.',\n"," 'We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.',\n"," 'But still, we change much more often.',\n"," \"We really don't give them the chance.\",\n"," 'Another trap is the success trap.',\n"," 'Facit fell into the success trap.',\n"," \"They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it.\",\n"," \"They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change.\",\n"," 'We are like that, too.',\n"," \"When we know something well, it's difficult to change.\",\n"," 'Bill Gates has said: \"Success is a lousy teacher.',\n"," 'It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail.\"',\n"," \"That's the challenge with success.\",\n"," 'So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.',\n"," 'And they apply to our companies.',\n"," 'The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.',\n"," \"And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.\",\n"," 'Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle.',\n"," 'I see other companies that say, \"I\\'ll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes.\"',\n"," 'Second one: think in multiple time scales.',\n"," \"I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one.\",\n"," 'Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.',\n"," \"So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important.\",\n"," 'Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.',\n"," \"But companies can't choose.\",\n"," 'They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.',\n"," 'Third: invite talent.',\n"," \"I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.\",\n"," \"I think it's a team sport.\",\n"," 'I think we need to allow challenging.',\n"," 'I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.',\n"," \"I think that's also what good parenting is about.\",\n"," 'Last one: be skeptical of success.',\n"," \"Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration.\",\n"," 'Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, \"Remember, you\\'re only human.\"',\n"," 'So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff.',\n"," \"But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.\",\n"," 'I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.',\n"," 'First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot?',\n"," 'And what can you do to challenge?',\n"," 'Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me?',\n"," 'Is that something I should do more of?',\n"," 'In my case, yes.',\n"," 'So let me leave you with this.',\n"," \"Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.\",\n"," 'Thank you.',\n"," 'So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure, but survive we have.',\n"," 'Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered, they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities.',\n"," 'And as the descendants of these explorers, we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.',\n"," 'But at the same time, distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other, it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.',\n"," \"We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite, and that our Sun's life is also finite.\",\n"," \"While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel, few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.\",\n"," 'Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check.',\n"," 'So just a quick show of hands here: how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days?',\n"," \"Well, that's a lot of you.\",\n"," 'How about a few weeks?',\n"," \"That's a decent amount.\",\n"," 'How about a few months?',\n"," \"That's pretty good too.\",\n"," 'Now, let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter.',\n"," 'Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days?',\n"," \"That's quite a lot.\",\n"," 'How about a few weeks?',\n"," 'So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.',\n"," 'Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found, and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.',\n"," 'Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars.',\n"," 'So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation?',\n"," 'Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?',\n"," 'Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet?',\n"," 'And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?',\n"," \"But I'm getting ahead of myself.\",\n"," \"In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun, we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself, in space, on a ship, a hermetic flying can, possibly for many generations.\",\n"," 'The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.',\n"," \"From astronauts' experiences in space, we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological.\",\n"," 'And what about macrogravity, or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on?',\n"," 'In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown.',\n"," \"So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.\",\n"," 'Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented: the microbe, a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing, living machine.',\n"," 'It requires fairly little to maintain, offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.',\n"," 'The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology.',\n"," 'It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body.',\n"," 'Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not, with incredible speed and fidelity.',\n"," 'Given the limitations of our man-made machines, synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space.',\n"," 'To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration, let us return to the Mars environment.',\n"," 'The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, with trace amounts of organic material.',\n"," \"Let's say, hypothetically, what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients?\",\n"," 'The first question we should probably ask is, how would we make our plants cold-tolerant?',\n"," 'Because, on average, the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade.',\n"," 'The next question we should ask is, how do we make our plants drought-tolerant?',\n"," 'Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word \"evaporate.\"',\n"," \"Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.\",\n"," 'By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them, we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.',\n"," \"They're known on Earth as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.\",\n"," 'Nature does stuff like this already, without our help.',\n"," 'We have simply found more precise ways to do it.',\n"," 'So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?',\n"," 'Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.',\n"," \"It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.\",\n"," 'One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments.',\n"," 'In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term.',\n"," 'These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.',\n"," 'So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us, but what else can we do?',\n"," 'Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species, were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.',\n"," 'That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there.',\n"," 'And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute, even given ample food, water, air and a suit, we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.',\n"," 'Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet, we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight, or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.',\n"," 'So let us appeal to nature for inspiration.',\n"," \"Among the plethora of life here on Earth, there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles, or lovers of extreme living conditions, if you'll remember from high school biology.\",\n"," 'And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.',\n"," 'It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation.',\n"," 'While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.',\n"," 'To do so is not particularly easy.',\n"," \"There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance, and it's not as simple as transferring one gene.\",\n"," 'But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time, I think to do so is not very hard either.',\n"," 'Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation, it would be infinitely better than what we already have, which is just the melanin in our skin.',\n"," \"Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.\",\n"," 'As difficult as it is to see, homo sapiens, that is humans, evolves every day, and still continues to evolve.',\n"," 'Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans, who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, the chemical element that can kill the average human being.',\n"," 'Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations.',\n"," 'But, and this is a big but, such evolution requires two things that we may not always have, or be able to afford, and they are death and time.',\n"," \"In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe, we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets.\",\n"," \"We're living in what E.O.\",\n"," 'Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention, during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements.',\n"," 'But with every passing day, we approach the age of volitional evolution, a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.',\n"," 'Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.',\n"," 'Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms, especially our own, is not without its moral and ethical quandaries.',\n"," 'Will engineering ourselves make us less human?',\n"," 'But then again, what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious?',\n"," 'Where should human genius direct itself?',\n"," 'Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.',\n"," 'How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves?',\n"," 'I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us.',\n"," 'We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage.',\n"," 'Mars is a destination, but it will not be our last.',\n"," \"Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.\",\n"," 'Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.',\n"," 'Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going.',\n"," 'The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself, and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.',\n"," 'Thank you.',\n"," \"OK, so, confession: I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.\",\n"," 'I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.',\n"," 'Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.',\n"," 'I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.',\n"," 'But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997, when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building.',\n"," \"Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brother was going to die, actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.\",\n"," 'He is definitely my hero.',\n"," \"But as much as  -- yeah, deserves it --\\n\\nBut as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worse it could have been; in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.\",\n"," \"They don't all make national headlines.\",\n"," \"In fact, most of them don't.\",\n"," \"They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal.\",\n"," 'So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising, which is to try to figure out how to engage people.',\n"," 'Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives.',\n"," 'And that comes down to finding common ground, where what I want overlaps with what you want.',\n"," 'And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence, just how much common ground there is.',\n"," \"Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt, a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.\",\n"," \"It's a proud tradition.\",\n"," 'Families.',\n"," 'In some places, the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.',\n"," 'What do hunters want?',\n"," 'Well, they want to hunt.',\n"," 'They love their guns.',\n"," 'They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns.',\n"," \"But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.\",\n"," \"In fact, there's a lot of it, starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.\",\n"," \"This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people.\",\n"," \"It's about keeping all guns away from certain people, and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns: convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill. We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.\",\n"," \"In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked 2.4 million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.\",\n"," \"And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks, just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane -- one with security and one with no security.\",\n"," 'And --\\n\\nAnd the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members.',\n"," 'This is not a controversial idea.',\n"," 'In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.',\n"," \"That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake.\",\n"," \"And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.\",\n"," \"That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.\",\n"," 'But what about the 300 million guns

put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?\",\n"," 'NR:  Um, no.',\n"," 'No, we got this.',\n"," 'LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and

this thing, it was huge.',\n"," \"It's a really big animal.\",\n"," 'LN: So what animal could it be?',\n"," 'Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,

flesh.',\n"," 'It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab: collagen.',\n"," 'Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.',\n"," 'And usually, after so many years, it breaks down.',\n"," 'But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.',\n"," 'Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called \"collagen fingerprinting.\"',\n"," 'It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match.',\n"," 'So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx.',\n"," 'NR: Yeah, you want to track it.',\n"," \"It's kind of important.\",\n"," 'LN: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.',\n"," 'And he found a match.',\n"," 'It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ... a camel.',\n"," \"NR: And I'm thinking, what?\",\n"," \"That's amazing -- if it's true.\",\n"," 'LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one.',\n"," 'However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.',\n"," 'So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton.',\n"," 'Yeah.',\n"," 'Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.',\n"," 'Now, when you hear the word \"camel,\" what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.',\n"," 'But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature -- hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.',\n"," 'So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?',\n"," \"Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American.\",\n"," 'They started here.',\n"," 'For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.',\n"," 'LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?',\n"," \"NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.\",\n"," \"You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes.\",\n"," 'LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.',\n"," 'NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits.',\n"," 'LN: What?',\n"," 'Rabbit-sized camels?',\n"," 'NR: The earliest ones.',\n"," 'So those ones you probably would not recognize.',\n"," 'LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.',\n"," \"NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?\",\n"," 'LN: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.',\n"," 'And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.',\n"," \"So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.\",\n"," 'Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.',\n"," 'Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.',\n"," 'So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.',\n"," 'But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over.',\n"," \"You'd have blizzards.\",\n"," \"You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.\",\n"," 'Like, how ... How?',\n"," 'How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?',\n"," 'Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.',\n"," \"And it's kind of brilliant.\",\n"," 'What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter?',\n"," 'What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?',\n"," 'What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat --\\n\\nwas there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce?',\n"," 'And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?',\n"," \"Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body.\",\n"," 'So it helps heat dissipate easier.',\n"," \"It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.\",\n"," \"Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.\",\n"," 'Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change.',\n"," 'But I love it for a totally different reason.',\n"," \"For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.\",\n"," 'So I was trained as a historian.',\n"," \"And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.\",\n"," 'They make sense of the past.',\n"," 'They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.',\n"," 'And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.',\n"," 'NR: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right?',\n"," \"That's a great story!\",\n"," \"It's totally adapted for that.\",\n"," 'Clearly, it always lived there.',\n"," 'LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.',\n"," 'You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.',\n"," 'Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought

returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers.',\n"," 'Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship?',\n"," 'Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews, and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over.',\n"," 'This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers, and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires.',\n"," 'Think about how far we have come.',\n"," 'Before this, most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all.',\n"," \"But now, not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind, but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé.\",\n"," 'This is the mark of real change, of true institutional shift, because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers, we can solve it for other career transitioners too.',\n"," 'In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program.',\n"," \"And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program.\",\n"," 'Different pool, same concept.',\n"," 'So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro.',\n"," 'Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.',\n"," 'Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department.',\n"," 'But it was a temp job.',\n"," 'The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more, but no guarantees.',\n"," 'This was in the fall of 2011.',\n"," 'Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house.',\n"," 'So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role, she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best.',\n"," 'Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle.',\n"," \"Fast forward to 2015, Tracy's been promoted.\",\n"," \"They've paid for her to get her MBA at night.\",\n"," \"She's even hired another relauncher to work for her.\",\n"," \"Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.\",\n"," 'Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers.',\n"," \"But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program.\",\n"," 'Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.',\n"," 'Thank you.',\n"," \"The following are my opinions, and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office.\",\n"," 'I am a prosecutor.',\n"," 'I believe in law and order.',\n"," 'I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser.',\n"," 'I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities.',\n"," 'I love my job and the people that do it.',\n"," \"I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better.\",\n"," 'By a show of hands, how many of you, by the age of 25, had either acted up in school, went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of, or drank alcohol before your legal age?',\n"," 'All right.',\n"," 'How many of you shoplifted, tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight -- yes, even with a sibling?',\n"," 'Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions?',\n"," \"How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?\",\n"," 'Point taken.',\n"," \"When we talk about criminal justice reform, we often focus on a few things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today.\",\n"," \"But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me, I'm going to give you a confession on my part.\",\n"," 'I went to law school to make money.',\n"," \"I had no interest in being a public servant, I had no interest in criminal law, and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.\",\n"," 'Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.',\n"," 'I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime.',\n"," 'My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.',\n"," 'I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only: \"Not guilty.\"',\n"," 'They were predominately black and brown.',\n"," 'And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.',\n"," 'They were predominately white.',\n"," \"As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom, I couldn't stop but think: How did they get here?\",\n"," 'I wanted to know their stories.',\n"," 'And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case, I was thinking to myself, we could have predicted that.',\n"," 'That seems so preventable... not because I was an expert in criminal law, but because it was common sense.',\n"," 'Over the course of the internship, I began to recognize people in the auditorium, not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any.',\n"," 'My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney, and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.',\n"," 'Even in our \"worst,\" I saw human stories.',\n"," 'And they all contained childhood trauma, victimization, poverty, loss, disengagement from school, early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system, all leading to a seat in a courtroom.',\n"," \"Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison, and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years when we could have reinvested it up front, and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.\",\n"," 'My third year of law school, I defended people accused of small street crimes, mostly mentally ill, mostly homeless, mostly drug-addicted, all in need of help.',\n"," 'They would come to us, and we would send them away without that help.',\n"," 'They were in need of our assistance.',\n"," \"But we weren't giving them any.\",\n"," 'Prosecuted, adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them.',\n"," 'The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work.',\n"," 'The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender.',\n"," 'The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor.',\n"," \"I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.\",\n"," 'We know the criminal justice system needs reform, we know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons, making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet.',\n"," \"We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole, we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color, particularly poor people of color.\",\n"," 'And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms.',\n"," 'But what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.',\n"," 'When we talk about criminal justice reform, we, as a society, focus on three things.',\n"," 'We complain, we tweet, we protest about the police, about sentencing laws and about prison.',\n"," 'We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.',\n"," 'In the fall of 2009, a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.',\n"," 'He was 18 years old, he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school.',\n"," \"He had his sights set on college but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school.\",\n"," 'In a series of bad decisions, he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.',\n"," 'This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.',\n"," 'The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.',\n"," 'But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.',\n"," \"I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk.\",\n"," \"And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment, I had Christopher's life in my hands.\",\n"," \"I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor, and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life.\",\n"," \"Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such, but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer.\",\n"," 'For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions, regardless of our intent.',\n"," 'Despite our broad discretion, we learn to avoid risk at all cost, rendering our discretion basically useless.',\n"," 'History has conditioned us to believe that somehow, the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety, despite evidence to the contrary.',\n"," \"We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case positions, dispositions, or to take risks on people we might not otherwise.\",\n"," \"We stick to an outdated method, counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want, and that's safer communities.\",\n"," 'Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.',\n"," 'They have little appreciation for what we can do.',\n"," 'Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today.',\n"," 'With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.',\n"," 'Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.',\n","
